# Operations Dashboard Analysis

## 1. Project Overview
As a practicing data analyst, I developed an interactive **Operations Dashboard** to provide a consolidated view of key operational metrics. The dashboard integrates data from **SQL Server** and **Excel** into **Power BI**, enabling seamless analysis and visualization of departmental costs, project statuses, budget allocations, and employee information. The goal of this dashboard is to enhance decision-making by offering insights into financial performance and project progress.

## 2. Data Integration Process
- **SQL Server**: Extracted core data such as employee information, department budgets, and project details.
- **Excel**: Supplemented with additional financial metrics, particularly salary costs and capital expenditures.
- **Power BI**: Loaded and transformed data from both sources. Data cleansing and preparation were done using Power BI's Power Query Editor.

## 3. Data Transformation and Calculations
To provide actionable insights, the following key calculations were performed:
- **Departmental Costs**: Aggregated costs by department, covering project expenditures, salary costs, and capital investments.
- **2-Year Budget Forecast**: Created projections for each department's budget over the next two years, based on historical financial data trends.
- **Project Status Tracking**: Segmented project statuses into completed, ongoing, and upcoming, with corresponding budget allocations.
- **Capital and Salary Costs**: Analyzed capital investments and salary expenditures by department, highlighting areas of overspending or surplus.

## 4. Key Dashboard Visualizations
- **Employee Information Panel**: A visual card presenting detailed employee information (ID, name, department, project, salary), allowing quick access for HR and managerial reviews.
- **Costs by Department (Donut Chart)**: Visualizes the breakdown of departmental costs, making it easy to compare financial allocations across departments.
- **Project Status (Donut Chart)**: Categorizes projects into completed, ongoing, and upcoming, alongside their respective budgets.
- **Budget by Department (Bar Chart)**: Shows department-wise budget allocations, highlighting significant investments such as in Sales and Marketing.
- **Budget by Project (Bar Chart)**: Offers a detailed view of budget allocations for key projects like "Product Launch" and "Brand Repositioning."
- **Financial Summary Table**: Displays project costs, salary costs, 2-year budget projections, and capital allocations across departments. Conditional formatting highlights financial risks.

## 5. Insights and Analysis
Key insights derived from the dashboard:
- **Heavy Investment in Sales and Marketing**: These departments receive the highest capital and project costs, indicating prioritization for revenue growth.
- **Capital Imbalance in Human Resources**: HR shows a negative capital balance of $25,000, suggesting potential financial mismanagement.
- **Engineering Department Surplus**: Engineering has a surplus of $770,000, potentially indicating over-budgeting or underutilization of resources.
- **Project Prioritization**: The "Product Launch" project has the highest budget allocation, underscoring its strategic importance.
- **Budget Forecast**: The 2-Year Budget forecasts significant increases in future investments for Engineering and Marketing.

## 6. Recommendations
To optimize financial performance and project success, I recommend the following actions:
- **Review HR Budget Allocations**: Conduct a thorough review of HR expenditures to realign spending with available capital.
- **Redistribute Engineering Surplus**: Reallocate surplus funds in Engineering to underfunded projects or departments.
- **Monitor Smaller Projects**: Track lower-budget projects to prevent delays and bottlenecks from underfunding.
- **Adjust Future Budget Projections**: Reassess the 2-Year Budget projections for IT and HR to ensure adequate funding.

## 7. Conclusion
The **Operations Dashboard** is a powerful tool for management to monitor financial and project performance across departments. It provides visibility into resource allocation, identifies areas for improvement, and highlights departments or projects requiring attention. By leveraging insights from this dashboard, organizations can make data-driven decisions to optimize resource utilization, balance budgets, and ensure the timely completion of projects.
